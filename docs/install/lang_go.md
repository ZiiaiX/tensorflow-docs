# Install TensorFlow for Go

TensorFlow provides a
[Go API](https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)â€”
particularly useful for loading models created with Python and running them
within a Go application.

Caution: The TensorFlow Go API is *not* covered by the TensorFlow
[API stability guarantees](/docs/tensorflow/guide/version_compat).


## Supported Platforms

TensorFlow for Go is supported on the following systems:

* Linux, 64-bit, x86
* macOS X, Version 10.12.6 (Sierra) or higher


## Setup

### TensorFlow C library

Install the [TensorFlow C library](/docs/tensorflow/install/lang_c) which is required for the
TensorFlow Go package.

### Download

Download and install the TensorFlow Go package and its dependencies:

    go get github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go

And validate your installation:

    go test github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go


## Build

### Example program

With the TensorFlow Go package installed, create an example program with the
following source code (`hello_tf.go`):

```
package main

import (
    tf "github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go"
    "github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/op"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // Construct a graph with an operation that produces a string constant.
    s := op.NewScope()
    c := op.Const(s, "Hello from TensorFlow version " + tf.Version())
    graph, err := s.Finalize()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Execute the graph in a session.
    sess, err := tf.NewSession(graph, nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    output, err := sess.Run(nil, []tf.Output{c}, nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(output[0].Value())
}
```

### Run

Run the example program:

    go run hello_tf.go

The command outputs: `Hello from TensorFlow version <number>`

Success: The TensorFlow for Go is configured.

The program may generate the following warning messages, which you can ignore:

W tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:45] The TensorFlow library
wasn't compiled to use *Type* instructions, but these are available on your
machine and could speed up CPU computations.

## Build from source

TensorFlow is open source. Read
[the instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/go/README)
to build TensorFlow for Go from source code.
